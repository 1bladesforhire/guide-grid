                    <p>For years, separate stores on Windows, Xbox, online, and in physical retail were confusing our visitors
                        and fans. Now we've unified them under one brand and one name: Microsoft Store. We're on a path to
                        a better and simpler experience.</p>
                    <p>These new guidelines cover the refreshed brand, expression, and scenarios for Microsoft Store. Understanding
                        and implementing these guidelines helps us build a consistent, effective, and lasting brand as we
                        evolve to serve our customers in a new way.</p>

                        <p>Buying technology today often seems to be just about the technology itself, a purely aesthetic representation of the product, not really about what it's used for.  While this may drive the initial sale, we believe that technology ultimately exists to help people with what they’re up against and to empower them to achieve more.</p>
                        <p>Our job at Microsoft Store is to remove barriers between people, their ideas, and ways to pursue them. It’s not just presenting great products—it's showing how to use them. It’s highlighting the creators of these products, sharing their stories, and inviting customers to co-create with us. Ultimately, it’s bringing people together and in that moment helping them achieve the new, the possible, and the impossible. </p>

                            For example, tienda Microsoft Store or магазин Microsoft Store.</p>

                            Avoid using "the" in front of Microsoft Store whenever possible.
                            Avoid truncating Microsoft Store.</p>
