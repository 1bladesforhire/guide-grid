                        <p>For years, separate stores on Windows, Xbox, online, and in physical retail were confusing our visitors and fans. Now we've unified them under one brand and one name: Microsoft Store. We're on a path to a better and simpler experience.</p>
                        <p>These new guidelines cover the refreshed brand, expression, and scenarios for Microsoft Store. Understanding and implementing these guidelines helps us build a consistent, effective, and lasting brand as we evolve to serve our customers in a new way.</p>

                                People today expect more from brands than simply good products. Consumers are looking for experiences, belonging, meaning, ideas, and inspiration. Yes, products are a part of this. But it's so much more. That's why we're evolving the Microsoft Store experience.

                            <p>We're not just here to sell stuff. We're here to help people figure out what, how, and when they can achieve whatever they want. Sometimes it involves a purchase, sometimes it doesn't. Either way we're here for the long term. That's why the relationships we build matter—and why they're based on empowering our customers. Empowering is about them, not us.</p>

                            <p>To be relevant, we need to be personal. That means conversing with people on their terms, listening to them, and figuring out what we can do to help. That means we understand what our customers are passionate about, how they talk, what they love, and how to build a more intimate connection with them. Like a magazine, Microsoft Store is about curating engaging editorial content that has customers coming back for more. </p>

                            <p>To create empowering relationships with our customers, we need to curate experiences that enhance their lives (and their Instagram and Snapchat feeds) rather than simply highlight material things. Be it hands-on explorations of new reality, engaging workshops, or breathtaking stories—our experiences help customers enhance their lives and achieve more.</p>

They follow great designers, artists, and role models and are not afraid to post a nice-looking selfie, curate a trendy Instagram feed, or be obsessed about doughnuts.

At times curious, at times procrastinating, they might miss a class or two (because partying is also living), but they ultimately want to do something meaningful, learn new things, evolve themselves, and follow their hearts.

These are the people who create electric cars in their garages, disrupt banking with new apps, test out rockets in the open fields, and simply dream of creating the next best thing.</p>
