                    <p>For years, separate stores on Windows, Xbox, online, and in physical retail were confusing our visitors
                        and fans. Now we've unified them under one brand and one name: Microsoft Store. We're on a path to
                        a better and simpler experience.</p>
                    <p>These new guidelines cover the refreshed brand, expression, and scenarios for Microsoft Store. Understanding
                        and implementing these guidelines helps us build a consistent, effective, and lasting brand as we
                        evolve to serve our customers in a new way.</p>

                    <p>
                        People today expect more from brands than simply good products. Consumers are looking for experiences, belonging, meaning,
                        ideas, and inspiration. Yes, products are a part of this. But it's so much more. That's why we're
                        evolving the Microsoft Store experience.

                        <p>We're not just here to sell stuff. We're here to help people figure out what, how, and when they
                            can achieve whatever they want. Sometimes it involves a purchase, sometimes it doesn't. Either

                            based on empowering our customers. Empowering is about them, not us.</p>

                        <p>To be relevant, we need to be personal. That means conversing with people on their terms, listening
                            to them, and figuring out what we can do to help. That means we understand what our customers
                            are passionate about, how they talk, what they love, and how to build a more intimate connection
                            with them. Like a magazine, Microsoft Store is about curating engaging editorial content that

                    <h4>We want to win the hearts and minds of Gamers, Creators, Learners, and Businesses</h4>
                    <p>To empower everyone, you need to start small and grow from there. Gamers, Creators, Learners, Businesses,
                        and among them— female and Hispanic customers— are the groups of people of action we are looking to attract.</p>
                    <p> Diverse and different, they are passionate, influential, millennially-minded and are open to new experiences.
                        They are looking for new stories, new communities, and new things they can achieve.</p>
                    <div class="quarter">
                        <h6>Gamers</h6>
                        <p>They love games. They play, stream, engage. They know game creators by heart, tattoo favorite characters
                            on their ankles, cosplay at gaming conferences, and simply love everything gaming. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="quarter">
                        <h6>Creators</h6>
                        <p>Obsessed with making things— from writing blogs to creating new technology and things. They follow great
                            designers, artists, and role models and are not afraid to post a nice-looking selfie, curate a trendy
                            Instagram feed, or be obsessed about doughnuts. Because why not be obsessed with them? Doughnuts
                            are totally awesome. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="quarter">
                        <h6>Learners</h6>
                        <p>From young to old—they are in a mindset of learning new things. At times curious, at times procrastinating,
                            they might miss a class or two (because partying is also living), but they ultimately want to do
                            something meaningful, learn new things, evolve themselves, and follow their hearts. Teachers and
                            students, learners and educators—they are on the lookout for new ideas, new concepts, and new things.
                            </p>

                    <div class="quarter">
                        <h6>Business</h6>
                        <p>The name says it all. Driven by a desire to create and grow business. On the lookout for new ideas, methods,
                            and opportunities. Not afraid of experiments and failures. These are the people who create electric
                            cars in their garages, disrupt banking with new apps, test out rockets in the open fields, and simply
                            dream of creating the next best thing.</p>

                        <p>Buying technology today often seems to be just about the technology itself, a purely aesthetic representation of the product, not really about what it's used for.  While this may drive the initial sale, we believe that technology ultimately exists to help people with what they’re up against and to empower them to achieve more.</p>
                        <p>Our job at Microsoft Store is to remove barriers between people, their ideas, and ways to pursue them. It’s not just presenting great products—it's showing how to use them. It’s highlighting the creators of these products, sharing their stories, and inviting customers to co-create with us. Ultimately, it’s bringing people together and in that moment helping them achieve the new, the possible, and the impossible. </p>
                        <p>That's what we do in Microsoft Store.</p>
